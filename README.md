# grunt-init "node" sample

This is sample output generated by the grunt-init "node" template.

_Note: this repository was generated dynamically using grunt-init v0.2.0rc1. Instead of
reporting issues here, please report any issues with this init template as
[grunt-init issues][issues]. Instead of watching or forking this repository,
watch [grunt-init][] instead._

## Project Creation Transcript
The following is a transcript of the session in which this project and
repository were created. This is not actually a part of the [grunt-init][]
"node" template, this session transcript was added afterwards. The
text after the `$` are the commands that were executed, and everything else is
program output.

**If you want to see the repository exactly as it was created by grunt-init, [view
the "generated" branch][generated].**

Note that this entire build process is automated by a rather complex [expect
script][expect], which is used to automate [grunt-init][] in order to
facilitate the creation of this and other sample repositories.

Running "init:node" (init) task
This task will create one or more files in the current directory, based on the
environment and the answers to a few questions. Note that answering "?" to any
question will show question-specific help and answering "none" to most questions
will leave its value blank.

"node" template notes:
Project name shouldn't contain "node" or "js" and should be a unique ID not
already in use at search.npmjs.org.
